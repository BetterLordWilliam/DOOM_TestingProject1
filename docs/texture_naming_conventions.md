# Texture Naming Conventions

Texture names shall be organized according to the following:

texture type, texture dimensions, texture name

## Texture Types

Seperate the textures by wall and flat.

Also seperate the textures by dimensions.

| Type | Notes |
| :- | :- |
| W | Wall texture (generic prefix) |
| F | Flat texture (generic prefix | 

> [!NOTE]
>
> There may be other types (more specific) but W and F will be used consistently to distinguish. Perhaps other classification details are more fitted for the name of the texture.

## Texture Dimensions

Common dimensions of textures in the game (inspired by the dimensions of textures in Doom/Hexen).
